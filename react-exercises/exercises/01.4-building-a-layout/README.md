# `01.4` Building a layout

Let's practice a little bit more about using JSX for creating HTML.

Now we have another object that is just a bit more complex than the last one.

# :speech_balloon: Instructions

Using the information you have on the `data` object build this small card.

```js
const data = {
  image: "https://ucarecdn.com/f8cf81eb-3bab-4bba-9431-668884eab174/-/resize/300x/",
  cardTitle: "Bob Dylan",
  cardDescription: "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer/songwriter, author, and artist who has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades.",
  button: {
    url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan",
    label: "Go to wikipedia"
  }
};
```
### Here is the HTML code for creating a bootstrap card:

```html
<div class="card m-5">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="Card image cap">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the cards content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
  </div>
</div>
````

### This is how your end result needs to look like:
